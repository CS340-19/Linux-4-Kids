# Lesson Plan Details for Linux-4-Kids

## Choosing our Target Audience
  Most of the topics we could include in the lesson plan are dependent on the age we choose for our audience. Ideally, the tutorial level would be accessible to a fairly young audience (maybe 6th grade and up?) and the introduction course would be better for an older group (maybe 14+?) who are beginning to use their computers for more complex tasks (i.e. artistic projects, more advanced schoolwork, etc.). 

## Potential Lengths of the Lesson Plan
  - Tutorial
    - A tutorial length course would ideally be completed in one to two 30-45 minute sessions and would provide basic skills for navigating a Linux environment.
  
  - Extended Introduction
    - This would span approximately a week of class sessions and would cover everything in the tutorial as well as more in depth coverage of things that would be needed on a regular basis by the audience.

- Introduction Course
    - This would be a course that guides the user from installation to a good understanding of their distribution as well as overarching themes/software common in other versions of Linux. After completeing this, they would ideally be able to use most mainstream distributions.

## Choosing a Distribution
  The distribution we choose should depend on our target audience.
  
  If we want to focus on students in a classroom setting, [Edubuntu](https://www.edubuntu.org/) is a variant of Ubuntu directed towards students of any age.
  
  If we want to focus on getting young, first time users comfortable with Linux for personal use...
  
   - [Ubuntu](www.ubuntu.com) would be a good option because it is easy to use out of the box & requires hardly any configuration, has a giant & helpful community & comes equipped with almost any program they might need for general use.
   
   - [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) is based on Ubuntu & has all of its easy to use features, as well as desktop that feels more like Windows for an easier transition. It also comes with more programs installed (Flash, etc.).
   
## Choosing VM Software
  - [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html) is free for personal use & is the most widely used vm software, however, it's only available for Windows & certain Linux distributions
  
  - [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is another widely used vm software that is available on Windows, Mac & most Linux distributions. The main drawback is that apparently it's a little harder to set up than vmware.

## Lesson Plan for a Basic Tutorial
  The tutorial lesson plan would include...
 
  - A brief introduction to the distribution & the pros & cons of using Linux rather than Windows/Mac.
  
  - A walkthrough of how to install a vm software & how to get a Linux image for it
  
  - How to set up the Linux distribution on the vm & basic configuration choices (time zone, username, password, etc.)
  
  - How to navigate the desktop environment (this would depend heavily on what distribution we choose) & how to make basic customizations
 
  - How to navigate the file system
 
  - How to update the OS & download software
  
  - A basic tour of the programs included in the install (the Libreoffice Suite, Firefox browser, etc.)
  
  - Where to go to get more help & what to do when you're stuck
  
## Lesson Plan for an Extended Introduction
  This would include everything in the tutorial, as well as...
  
  - More details on customization (i.e. choosing a browser)
  
  - A basic introduction to the command line
  
  - How to use the email client (i.e. Thunderbird on Ubuntu)
  
  - A deeper how-to on the LibreOffice suite & the important differences between it & Microsoft Office
  
  - A section on common pitfalls & how to fix them
  
  - Basic introduction on how to use drivers to set up printers, webcams, mics, etc.
  
## Lessons for an Introduction Course
  This would go into more depth on topics introduced by the first two tutorials. Specifically, it would focus on the command line, more distribution specific software & basic system maintenance. It would also add more material on the history of Linux, info on other popular distributions, and FOSS in general. There could also be small lessons on getting popular software set up like steam, wine, etc.
