# Navigating the File System

  The differences between the file system on a Windows desktop & a file system on an Ubuntu desktop can be surprising.
In order to be able to do the things you typically do on your computer, like editing a school paper or writing a resume, you will need to understand these differences.

  The easiest way to move around your Ubuntu file system is with the "Files" application. It appears on the left sidebar of your desktop. It opens to the home folder, which holds all of your user files. However, don't confuse this with the root directory. The root directory holds all of the files on the entire system, while a home folder (or directory) holds only your files. For example, if your friend Dontonio also had a user profile on your computer, all of his files would be seperate from your, in his home folder. 
  
  You can create new folders by right clicking on the Files space & selecting "New Folder". You can also see many characteristics of the folder, such as the size of what your folder holds, by right clicking and then selecting "Properties".

  Something to keep in mind when editing files on any Linux system is that file extensions are not automatically added to files on creation most of the time. They must be correctly added by you. 
  
  Have fun exploring the file system on your Ubuntu computer. However, be careful to not delete your important files.
