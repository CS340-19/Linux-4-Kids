# Navigating the Desktop Environment

  Like we said earlier in the tutorial, Ubuntu uses the GNOME 3 desktop environment. One of the most obvious ones is the sidebar on the left of the screen. On installation, it has icons for the LibreOffice suite, which we will talk about later, the FireFOx browser, Files & the Terminal. You can add your own icons to this bar for easy access. For example, if you like Chrome as your internet browser, you can install it and add it to your sidebar. 
  
  On the bottom of the sidebar is a square full of dots. That is "Applications". It has a search bar for you to search any of the programs on your computer. We will take more about the pre-installed options available for you later.
  
  There is also a bar at the top of your screen. It is always visible and has information that you can quickly access is you need it, like the date, time & calendar feature in the center of the bar. On the right hand side where your computer tells you if it has an internet connection and its battery level. If you click on this area, you will get more information on volume, screen brightness, and options for locking or shutting down your computer.
  
  On the far side of the bar on top of your screen is the "Activities" view. If you click it, you can seamlessly switch between the windows you have open. This is good for things like writing a paper in Writer & checking your source on your internet browser.
