# Even More Vocabulary - Under Construction

Here are some words we'll be using throughout this tutorial.

## Desktop Environment
  
  We typically interact with our computers through the desktop environment. It's the home screen you see when you log into your computer and it's how we navigate to many of the features we use daily, such as our internet browser or our file editors. Ubuntu comes with a desktop environment called GNOME 3, which you will find in many other Linux distributions. 
  
## Terminal
  
  The terminal, or the command line, is another tool which we can use to interact with our computers. Rather than clicking around your desktop environment with the mouse, you type what you want your computer to do. This can seem strange at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's a much faster way of doing things with your computer. A little command line know-how can go a long way.

## File System
  
  A file system is a way of organizing the files on a computer. There are many kinds of file systems across many different operating systems. If you're coming from a Windows operating system, you will find there are some big changes in the ways you interact with Ubuntu's file system. We will go over these differences later in this tutorial.

## Directory *This needs to be revised*

  Directories are the way that the linux file system creates its hierarchical structure. Think of it as a tree, with branches as directories and leaves as files. Branches grow off of the tree, and then off of each other. Directories do the same thing. Directories can contain other directories. The directory at the base of the tree is the root directory and all other directories grow off of it.
