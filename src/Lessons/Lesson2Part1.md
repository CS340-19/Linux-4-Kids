# About Ubuntu
  Ubuntu is a Linux distribution that was created to be easy to use as well as free for everyone. According to its founders, its name is an African word meaning, "humanity to others", which emphasizes its mission to be available to everyone.
  We chose Ubuntu for this tutorial for these reasons as well as many others. Some distinguishing features of Ubuntu are

- A large community - Ubuntu has a large amount of people using it regularly (this community is called a *userbase*), so if you have a question that is not covered by this tutorial, you can likely find it somewhere else within the community documentation
- An easy-to-use environment - Ubuntu uses a desktop environment called GNOME 3, which is open source. It was made to be easy to use and has special modifications that can be made for various disabilities.
- Many pre-installed applications - Ubuntu comes with most of the applications you would use on a daily basis, like a browser & a word processor, already installed.
- Easy to maintain - Ubuntu versions that have been well tested (called stable versions) come out every 2 years, so major updates do not happen often.
