# Some differences between Ubuntu & Windows
- There are many different types of Ubuntu (called *flavors*) that each have a purpose. Windows has one version main version for desktop computers that has major updates every few years.
- Ubuntu is open source, meaning any one can look at the code and/or make changes to it. Windows is proprietary, so a user cannot see all of the inner workings of a windows system.
- Linux distributions have different file systems than Windows systems. While a Linux distribution can be personalized to have almost any file system the user wants, it typically has a tree structure. We will discuss these differences more later in the tutorial.
