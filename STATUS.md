### Introduction

Samar - I will likely add my failed attempt to setup jenkins to automate
our build process thursday night.

hightlights of what was accomplished

overview of changes to requirements, design, major events

### Customer Value

Samar - I would say we likely fall under no changes unless you can think of something

Changes from the project proposal
  -date of Changes
  -motivation for Changes
  -description of change including implications
if no changes - note "no changes"


### Technology

Architecture: components and their relationships - provide details about
design and implementation of your software

what were your goals for this iteration

what works - screenshots

what tests have you run

what are your goals for the next iteration


### Team

Samar - I'd like to get the whole team working more on adding code Changes
to components and styling. I've set up most so far with a little help since I
have experience, but I should be able to outline specific tasks now that everyone
can do. 

what roles did team members have for this iteration

do you expect team member roles to change going forward



### Project Managment

is the product on schedule

provide any updates to the schedule since the start of the semester


### Reflection

Samar - After getting the framework working with the UI library and other
dependencies progress has been quicker. I can write about this later or someone
can BS, either way

For this iteration:
  - What went well
  - what didn't go well
  - what will you do differently in the next iteration
